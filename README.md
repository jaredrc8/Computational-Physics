This repository contains the projects from my PHYS 381: Computational Physics I course at the University of Calgary in Winter 2025.

All code written by Jared Crebo on VS Code in Jupyter Python.

Assignment 1: Finding the Minima of Functions

This assignment implements the Bisection and Newton-Raphson methods to solve for the minimum of functions. The minimum potential energy is numerically approximated between two ion Na+ and Cl- which represents the distance at which the system is at stable equilibrium. 

Assignment 2: The Pendulum Problem

This assignment uses the trapezoid rule, the 2nd order Runge-Kutta, and the 4th order Runge-Kutta methods to simulate the motion of a driven, damped, oscillating pendulum. 

Assignment 3: Projectile Motion Under Air Resistance

This assignment uses the Euler method to simulate projectile motion with varying scales of air resistance under different assumptions. 

Assignment 4: Fourier Analysis

This assignment uses the Fourier series and Fourier transform to approximate periodic and non-periodic functions for signal analysis. Code implements the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a signal with noise filtration. 

Assignment 5: Curve Fitting, Optimization, and Finite Difference Methods

This assignment explored using the least-squares method to fit nonlinear curves to datasets using SciPy Optimize with the Nelder-Mead optimization method to minimize the $\chi^{2}$. 
The Finite Difference Method was employed to simulate the electric potential of a point source charge in the center of a 2D grid, bound by grounded walls.
